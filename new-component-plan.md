# New Component Plan

For this project, I'll be looking at implementing file uploading using a middleware called Multer.
With multer, I've been looking at using it to store images locally instead of having to pay a fee for cloud storage. Basically the way I have it implemented allows me to upload files through a call in postman to the API itself. It also offers a file filtering method to only allow specific file types, and a file size filter so that the local storage doesn't run out of space fast.

## For Future Implementation

These are resources that I intend to look at during the break and if I get the money to pay for the services required.
This is to enhance/expand the image storing feature using multer, to upload images to an online database to better protect the images.
